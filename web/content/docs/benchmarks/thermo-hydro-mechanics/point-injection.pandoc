## Problem description

A 2D axisymmertic model is set up for this verification.
 A line source is seleted to represent the injection
 source which is located between center point
of the quarter and the closest node. After the axisymmetric rotation around
the vertical direction, the line source has converted into a circular source and
the Neumann boundary heat flux can be thus calculated. The
radius of the domain is 10m and the initial temperature and pore pressure are
273.15K and 0Pa respectively.

## Results and evaluation

See [this PDF](../THM.pdf).

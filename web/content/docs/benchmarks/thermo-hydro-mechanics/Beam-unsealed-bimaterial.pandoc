## Problem description

A composite material composed of a cylindrical core and an annular domain of a different
material were modelled as an axisymmetric domain with three materials was set up.
The third material is the interface between the two material domains by which we control 
the mechanical and hydraulic connectivity of the two adjacent domains.
In this case, A hydraulic connection is established between the two reservoirs. To
estimate the average modulus of the bi-material domain, the rule of mixtures
was applied.

## Results and evaluation
